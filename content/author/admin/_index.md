I am a fifth-year MD/MHS candidate and an incoming research-track resident physician in the Department of Anesthesiology at Duke University School of Medicine. During my time in medical school I received formal research training through the Duke Clinical Research Training Program. My primary interests include risk prediction and assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effects in the context of peri-operative organ injury and critical care.
