I am a resident physician-scientist in the Department of Anesthesiology at the Duke University School of Medicine with plans to pursue a fellowship in Pediatric Anesthesiology. My primary interests include risk prediction and rigorous assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effects in an effort to develop tools to guide patient-specific clinical decisions in the perioperative period.
